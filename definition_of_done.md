# The Definition of Done

_The DoD is a clear and concise list of requirements that a User Story must adhere to for the team to call it complete. Until this list is satisfied, the user story cannot be considered complete._

Each user story and software increment must have been through this checklist:
- JIRA / the board is kept up to date throughout the process
- Has been demoed to the Business / Product Owner in test or pre-production or equivalent UAT environment
- Meets the Acceptance Criteria as described
- All QA / AQA tests must be passed
- Meets development best practices and coding standards as defined in document
- Code has been refactored and commented
- Code has been peer-reviewed
- Code is committed / checked into Git / equivalent versioning client
- Documentation is up to date:
  - Technical documentation (at the very least a README.md file)
  - Solution Design Document
  - Schema / Cube Design / model document(s)
  - QA documentation as appropriate
